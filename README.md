# reminders

Web app that lets you create reminders by entering text into a text field. The title and time is extracted from the text
using a natural language date parser (chrono.js). Reminders are saved as events in google calendar and an email reminder
is sent at the time of event. App is 100% client side and only communicates with the google api's.
